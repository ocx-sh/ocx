# Agent Instructions

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging on confirmation prompts.

Shell commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to include `-i` (interactive) mode on some systems, causing the agent to hang indefinitely waiting for y/n input.

**Use these forms instead:**
```bash
# Force overwrite without prompting
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file

# For recursive operations
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

**Other commands that may prompt:**
- `scp` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive
- `ssh` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` to fail instead of prompting
- `apt-get` - use `-y` flag
- `brew` - use `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` env var

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, complete these steps:

1. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
2. **Commit all changes** - Stage and commit with descriptive messages
3. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- NEVER push to remote — the human decides when to push (CI has real cost)
- All changes must be committed locally on a feature branch
- NEVER commit directly to main
