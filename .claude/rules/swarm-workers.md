# Swarm Worker Guidelines

Rules for efficient multi-agent swarm execution.

## Context Efficiency

1. **Workers inherit session context** - CLAUDE.md and rules are loaded, but workers use focused tool sets
2. **Narrow scope** - Each worker focuses on one task
3. **Minimal tools** - Only tools needed for the task
4. **Right-sized models** - Haiku for exploration, Sonnet for implementation, Opus for architecture

## Worker Types

| Worker | Model | Tools | Use |
|--------|-------|-------|-----|
| `worker-architecture-explorer` | sonnet | Read, Glob, Grep | Architecture discovery |
| `worker-explorer` | haiku | Read, Glob, Grep | Fast codebase search |
| `worker-builder` | opus | Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep | Implementation/testing/refactoring |
| `worker-tester` | sonnet | Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep | Test writing and validation |
| `worker-reviewer` | opus | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash | Code review/security analysis |
| `worker-researcher` | sonnet | Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, WebSearch | External research |
| `worker-architect` | opus | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep | Complex design decisions |

## Worker Focus Modes

Orchestrators specialize workers by specifying a focus mode in the prompt.

**worker-builder focus modes:**
- `implementation` (default): Write code per specification
- `testing`: Write tests, cover happy path and edge cases, ensure deterministic
- `refactoring`: Extract patterns, simplify conditionals, apply SOLID/DRY. Follow Two Hats Rule (see code-quality.md)

**worker-reviewer focus modes:**
- `quality` (default): Code review checklist — naming, style, tests, patterns
- `security`: OWASP Top 10 scan, hardcoded secrets, auth/authz flows, input validation. Reference CWE IDs. See security.md
- `performance`: N+1 queries, blocking I/O, allocations, pagination, caching. See code-quality.md

## Swarm Patterns

### Parallel Exploration
```
Orchestrator spawns 4-8 worker-explorer agents simultaneously
Each searches different parts of codebase
Results aggregated for next phase
```

### Divide and Conquer
```
1. worker-architect designs solution
2. Orchestrator decomposes into N tasks
3. N worker-builder agents execute in parallel
4. worker-reviewer validates each output
5. Orchestrator integrates
```

### Security Sweep
```
worker-reviewer (focus: security) scans all components in parallel
Findings aggregated and prioritized
worker-builder fixes critical/high issues
```

## Coordination Protocol

1. **Orchestrator** decomposes task into clear assignments
2. **Workers** pick up assigned tasks and begin execution
3. **Workers** complete task following AGENTS.md "Session Completion" workflow
4. **Workers** report completion to orchestrator
5. **Orchestrator** integrates and verifies

### Worker Completion Requirements

When a worker completes its assigned task, it MUST follow the full completion protocol from AGENTS.md:

1. File issues for remaining work
2. Run quality gates via `task verify` (if code changed) — run `task --list` to discover available commands
3. **Commit all changes** on the feature branch
4. Report completion to orchestrator

**Critical**: NEVER push to remote — the human decides when to push (CI has real cost).

## Performance Tips

- Launch multiple explorers for broad searches
- Use worker-architect for decisions, worker-builder for execution
- Parallelize independent tasks (max 8 concurrent workers)
- Keep worker prompts under 500 tokens for fast startup

## Anti-Patterns

- NO loading full context into workers
- NO sharing state between workers
- NO workers spawning workers (single-level only)
- NO long-running workers (timeout at 5 min)
- NO opus for simple tasks (cost optimization)
- NO pushing to remote (human decides when to push — CI has real cost)
